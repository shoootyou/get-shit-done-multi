# Plan 08-01: Root Documentation

## Objective

Create three essential root documentation files that establish project identity and contribution workflow: README.md (brief hub linking to detailed docs), CONTRIBUTING.md (development setup), and CHANGELOG.md (version history in Keep a Changelog format).

## Context

**Current state:** README.md exists but is too long (~150+ lines), has emojis, and doesn't follow hub-and-spoke pattern. CHANGELOG.md exists with v2.0 entries but needs validation against Keep a Changelog spec. CONTRIBUTING.md doesn't exist yet.

**Why this matters:** Root documentation is the first impression for npm package page viewers and GitHub visitors. Brief README drives users to detailed docs/, CONTRIBUTING.md enables community participation, and CHANGELOG.md provides transparent version history.

**From CONTEXT.md:** Hub-and-spoke pattern (brief README, detailed docs/), no emojis, natural human writing, ASCII diagrams in README (npm compatibility), proper attribution to original author (Lex Christopherson).

**From RESEARCH.md:** Keep a Changelog format is industry standard (v1.1.0 spec), README should be 50-150 lines for npm compatibility, CONTRIBUTING.md should include development setup + PR process + commit format.

## Tasks

<task name="rewrite-readme" type="auto">
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite README.md following hub-and-spoke pattern (brief hub, links to docs/):

**Structure:**
1. Header with badges (npm version, downloads, license)
2. Project description (2-3 paragraphs explaining what GSD does)
3. Quick Start section with npx command
4. ASCII diagram showing high-level workflow (User → Orchestrator → Researcher/Planner → Executor → Verifier)
5. Supported Platforms list (Claude, Copilot, Codex)
6. Documentation section with links to key docs (docs/how-to-install.md, docs/how-gsd-works.md, docs/platform-comparison.md, docs/README.md)
7. Requirements section (Node.js 20+, platform requirement)
8. Credits & License section with proper attribution to Lex Christopherson

**Key constraints:**
- Total length: 50-150 lines
- NO emojis (remove all existing emojis)
- Natural human writing (friendly but professional)
- ASCII diagram for workflow (use box-drawing characters: ┌ └ ┐ ┘ │ ─ → ↓)
- Proper attribution: "This project is a multi-platform adaptation of the original [get-shit-done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) framework by Lex Christopherson."
- Explain key differences: "Original: Claude-only with direct .md skills. This version: Multi-platform support using templating system."

**ASCII diagram template:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User runs {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}gsd-plan-phase                     │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Orchestrator: Spawns researcher → planner → executor           │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
       (workflow continues...)
```

**What to remove:**
- Excessive emojis throughout document
- Over-detailed explanations (move to docs/)
- Multiple redundant sections
- Corporate language ("leverage", "utilize")

**What to keep:**
- Current badges (npm, license)
- Core value proposition
- Quick start commands
- Attribution section (expand with more detail)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Check file length: `wc -l README.md` (should be 50-150 lines)
2. Verify no emojis: `grep -o '[😀-🙏]' README.md` (should return nothing)
3. Check ASCII diagram renders: View README.md in text editor (should see box characters)
4. Verify attribution exists: `grep -i "lex christopherson" README.md` (should find attribution)
5. Check links work: All links to docs/ are relative (not absolute URLs)
  </verify>
  <done>README.md is brief hub (50-150 lines), ASCII diagram present, no emojis, proper attribution to Lex Christopherson, links to detailed docs/</done>
</task>

<task name="create-contributing" type="auto">
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development setup and contribution workflow:

**Structure:**
1. Welcome message (thank you for interest)
2. Development Setup section:
   - Prerequisites (Node.js 20+, npm 9+, Git)
   - Installation steps (`git clone`, `cd`, `npm install`)
   - Running tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`)
   - Test isolation note (all tests run in /tmp, never modify source)
3. Code Style section:
   - ESLint and Prettier usage
   - Commands: `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm run lint:fix`
4. Pull Request Process section:
   - Create feature branch
   - Make changes with tests
   - Run linting and tests
   - Update documentation
   - Submit PR with clear description
5. Commit Message Format section:
   - Conventional Commits format
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Examples: `feat(installer): add --custom-path option`
6. Reporting Issues section:
   - Bug reports (description, steps, environment, logs)
   - Feature requests (use case, proposed solution, alternatives)
   - Security issues (email instead of public issues)
7. Code of Conduct (brief: "Be respectful and constructive")

**Testing emphasis:**
```markdown
### Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.js
\`\`\`

**Important:** All tests execute in `/tmp` with isolated directories. Tests never modify source files in `.github/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `get-shit-done/` directories.
```

**Commit format examples:**
```markdown
## Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
\`\`\`
feat(installer): add --custom-path option
fix(platform): resolve symlinks correctly on macOS
docs(readme): update installation instructions
\`\`\`
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Check file exists: `test -f CONTRIBUTING.md && echo "exists"`
2. Verify sections present: `grep -c "^## " CONTRIBUTING.md` (should be 6-8 sections)
3. Check test isolation mentioned: `grep -i "/tmp" CONTRIBUTING.md`
4. Verify Conventional Commits reference: `grep -i "conventional commits" CONTRIBUTING.md`
5. Validate markdown: `npx markdownlint-cli2 CONTRIBUTING.md` (should pass)
  </verify>
  <done>CONTRIBUTING.md exists with development setup, PR process, test commands, commit format, and security reporting</done>
</task>

<task name="validate-changelog" type="auto">
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Validate and update CHANGELOG.md to conform to Keep a Changelog v1.1.0 spec:

**Read current CHANGELOG.md** and verify it has:
1. Title: "# Changelog"
2. Intro paragraph with links to Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning
3. [Unreleased] section at top (for future changes)
4. Version sections in reverse chronological order (newest first)
5. Version format: `## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-30` (with date)
6. Change categories (in order): Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
7. Clear descriptions under each category (bullet points)

**If CHANGELOG.md doesn't conform, update it:**

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

</task>

## Verification

After completing all tasks:

```bash
# 1. Verify README length
wc -l README.md  # Should be 50-150 lines

# 2. Check no emojis in any file
grep -o '[😀-🙏]' README.md CONTRIBUTING.md CHANGELOG.md  # Should be empty

# 3. Validate all markdown
npx markdownlint-cli2 README.md CONTRIBUTING.md CHANGELOG.md  # Should pass

# 4. Verify attribution exists
grep -i "lex christopherson" README.md  # Should find proper credit

# 5. Check CHANGELOG format
grep "keepachangelog.com" CHANGELOG.md  # Should find reference link

# 6. Verify CONTRIBUTING has required sections
grep "^## Development Setup" CONTRIBUTING.md
grep "^## Pull Request Process" CONTRIBUTING.md
grep "^## Commit Message Format" CONTRIBUTING.md

# 7. Test npm pack compatibility
npm pack --dry-run  # Should complete without errors
```

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] README.md is 50-150 lines with ASCII diagram
- [ ] No emojis in any root documentation
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md has development setup and PR process
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] All three files pass markdownlint validation
- [ ] README includes proper attribution to Lex Christopherson
- [ ] All relative links in README point to docs/ (will be created in Wave 2)

## Success Criteria

**Outcome:** Root documentation establishes project identity and enables community participation.

**Observable Truths:**
1. User visits npm package page → sees brief README with clear value proposition and ASCII diagram
2. User wants to install → README has Quick Start section with single command
3. Contributor wants to help → CONTRIBUTING.md explains setup, testing, and PR process
4. User checks version history → CHANGELOG.md shows what changed in v2.0.0
5. User seeks detailed info → README links to docs/ folder (created in later plans)
6. User researches project origin → README credits Lex Christopherson and explains relationship

## Output

Three updated root files:
- `README.md` — Brief hub (50-150 lines) with ASCII diagram, links to docs/, attribution to Lex Christopherson
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Development setup, PR process, commit format, test isolation note
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Keep a Changelog format, v2.0.0 release documented with features from all 7 phases
