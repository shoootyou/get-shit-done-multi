# Phase 08 Plan 01: Root Documentation Files

## Objective

Create the three essential root documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md) that provide project overview, contribution guidelines, and version history. These files establish the project's professional documentation foundation and properly attribute the fork origin.

## Context

**Project Identity:**
- **Project name:** Get Shit Done Multi (GSD Multi)
- **npm package:** get-shit-done-multi
- **Fork point:** v1.6.4 from glittercowboy/get-shit-done
- **Original author:** Lex Christopherson
- **Version timeline:**
  - v1.7.0 (2026-01-19): Multi-CLI support experiments (Codex CLI added)
  - v1.8.0 (2026-01-20): Milestone archiving and mapping improvements
  - v2.0.0 (current): Full multi-platform + template system achievement

**Writing Style Requirements (from 08-01-CONTEXT.md):**
- No emojis in any documentation
- Natural human writing (friendly but professional)
- Layered approach (quick start, then details)
- ASCII diagrams in README.md (npm compatibility)
- Use "you" pronouns (direct, friendly)

**README.md Requirements:**
- Brief hub format (50-150 lines total)
- ASCII diagram showing high-level GSD workflow
- Links to detailed docs/ folder
- Proper attribution to original author
- Clear explanation of fork point and key differences
- Version timeline showing fork development journey

**CHANGELOG.md Requirements:**
- Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com/)
- Header note: "Forked from v1.6.4 of [glittercowboy/get-shit-done]..."
- Include version timeline: v1.7.0, v1.8.0, v2.0.0
- Keep existing entries as-is (document fork journey)

## Tasks
