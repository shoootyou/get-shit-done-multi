# Phase 08 Plan 02: Installation Documentation

## Objective

Create five installation-focused documentation files that guide users through installation, upgrade, uninstall, and troubleshooting. Each document follows a layered structure (Quick Start → Details → Troubleshooting) and includes real, copy-paste ready commands.

## Context

**Documentation Strategy (from 08-01-CONTEXT.md):**
- Question-driven file names (how-to-install.md, not installation.md)
- Layered structure: Quick Start (30 sec) → Details (5 min) → Advanced (15+ min)
- No emojis, natural human writing
- Real examples from actual codebase
- Professional but friendly tone

**Installation Modes (from REQUIREMENTS.md):**
- Interactive (default): `npx get-shit-done-multi`
- Platform flags: `--claude`, `--copilot`, `--codex`
- Scope flags: `--local`, `--global`
- Confirmation: `--yes` or `-y`
- Help: `--help` or `-h`
- Version: `--version` or `-v`

**File Locations (from REQUIREMENTS.md PLATFORM-03, 04, 04B):**
- Claude: `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/get-shit-done/`
- Copilot: `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`, `.github/get-shit-done/`
- Codex: `.codex/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, `.codex/get-shit-done/`
- Global: `~/.[platform]/` or `~/.copilot/` for Copilot

**Common Issues (from research and testing):**
- Permission denied (need sudo or --local)
- Insufficient disk space
- Existing installation conflicts
- Path resolution on Windows
- Symlink permission prompts

## Tasks

<task name="create-how-to-install" type="auto">
  <files>docs/how-to-install.md</files>
  <action>
    Create docs/how-to-install.md with layered structure:

    **Quick Start (30 seconds):**
    ```markdown
    # How to Install GSD

    Run this command to install GSD skills to your AI assistant:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi
    \`\`\`

    The installer will:
    1. Detect your platform (Claude, Copilot, or Codex)
    2. Ask which skills/agents to install
    3. Install to the appropriate location
    4. Confirm success

    Done. Your AI assistant now has GSD capabilities.
    ```

    **Installation Options (5 minutes):**
    Explain flags and modes:

    1. **Interactive Mode (Default):**
       - Auto-detects platforms
       - Multi-select skills/agents
       - Prompts for confirmation

    2. **Non-Interactive Mode:**
       ```bash
       npx get-shit-done-multi --claude --yes
       npx get-shit-done-multi --copilot --local --yes
       npx get-shit-done-multi --codex --global --yes
       ```

    3. **Platform Selection:**
       - `--claude`: Install to Claude Code
       - `--copilot`: Install to GitHub Copilot CLI
       - `--codex`: Install to Codex CLI
       - Multiple flags supported: `--claude --copilot`

    4. **Installation Scope:**
       - `--local`: Install to current project (`.claude/`, `.github/`, `.codex/`)
       - `--global`: Install globally (`~/.claude/`, `~/.copilot/`, `~/.codex/`)
       - Default: Prompt in interactive, local in non-interactive

    5. **Other Flags:**
       - `--yes` or `-y`: Skip confirmation prompts
       - `--help` or `-h`: Show usage information
       - `--version` or `-v`: Show installed versions

    **Understanding What Gets Installed (15+ minutes):**

    1. **Skills (29 total):**
       - Located in `[platform]/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`
       - Commands like `/gsd-plan-phase`, `/gsd-execute-phase`, `/gsd-verify-phase`
       - Each skill has frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)

    2. **Agents (13 total):**
       - Located in `[platform]/agents/gsd-*.agent.md`
       - Specialized sub-agents (gsd-executor, gsd-planner, gsd-verifier, etc.)
       - Each agent has frontmatter (name, description, tools, skills)

    3. **Shared Directory:**
       - Located in `[platform]/get-shit-done/`
       - Contains references, templates, workflows
       - Includes `.gsd-install-manifest.json` for tracking

    4. **Platform-Specific Locations:**
       Table showing Claude/Copilot/Codex paths

    **Requirements:**
    - Node.js 20+
    - One of: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, or Codex CLI
    - Sufficient disk space (approximately 2MB)
    - Write permissions to target directory

    **Next Steps:**
    - See [What Gets Installed](what-gets-installed.md) for detailed file breakdown
    - See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if you encounter issues
    - See [Platform Specifics](platform-specifics.md) for platform differences

    **Style:**
    - No emojis
    - Use "you" pronouns
    - Real commands (copy-paste ready)
    - Professional but friendly

</task>

<task name="create-how-to-upgrade" type="auto">
  <files>docs/how-to-upgrade.md</files>
  <action>
    Create docs/how-to-upgrade.md explaining update process:

    **Quick Start:**
    ```markdown
    # How to Upgrade GSD

    Upgrading is the same as installing:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi
    \`\`\`

    The installer detects existing installations and prompts you to upgrade if outdated.
    ```

    **How Update Detection Works:**

    1. **Manifest-Based Detection:**
       - Installer reads `.gsd-install-manifest.json` in each installation path
       - Compares installed version vs. current version
       - Checks ALL installations (global + local, all platforms)

    2. **Version Display:**
       ```bash
       npx get-shit-done-multi --version
       ```
       Shows all installed versions:
       ```
       Installed versions:
       - Claude (global): v2.0.1 at ~/.claude/get-shit-done/
       - Copilot (local): v2.0.0 at .github/get-shit-done/
       - Codex (global): v2.0.1 at ~/.codex/get-shit-done/
       ```

    3. **Multi-Platform Upgrades:**
       - Installer prompts for each outdated installation
       - You can upgrade all, some, or none
       - Each platform upgraded independently

    **Upgrade Process:**

    1. Pre-flight validation (disk space, permissions)
    2. Backup not performed (templates are read-only)
    3. Overwrite existing files with new versions
    4. Update manifest with new version and timestamp
    5. Confirm success

    **Breaking Changes:**
    - Major version updates (v2.x → v3.x) may have breaking changes
    - Check CHANGELOG.md before upgrading
    - Minor/patch updates (v2.0.x → v2.1.x) are safe

    **Downgrading:**
    Not supported. To revert:
    1. Uninstall current version
    2. Install specific older version (if available)

    **Next Steps:**
    - See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for version history
    - See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if upgrade fails

<task name="create-how-to-uninstall" type="auto">
  <files>docs/how-to-uninstall.md</files>
  <action>
    Create docs/how-to-uninstall.md with removal instructions:

    **Quick Start:**
    ```markdown
    # How to Uninstall GSD

    Remove GSD by deleting the installation directories:

    **Claude:**
    \`\`\`bash
    # Local installation
    rm -rf .claude/skills/gsd-* .claude/agents/gsd-* .claude/get-shit-done/

    # Global installation
    rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/gsd-* ~/.claude/agents/gsd-* ~/.claude/get-shit-done/
    \`\`\`

    **Copilot:**
    \`\`\`bash
    # Local installation
    rm -rf .github/skills/gsd-* .github/agents/gsd-* .github/get-shit-done/

    # Global installation
    rm -rf ~/.copilot/skills/gsd-* ~/.copilot/agents/gsd-* ~/.copilot/get-shit-done/
    \`\`\`

    **Codex:**
    \`\`\`bash
    # Local installation
    rm -rf .codex/skills/gsd-* .codex/agents/gsd-* .codex/get-shit-done/

    # Global installation
    rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/gsd-* ~/.codex/agents/gsd-* ~/.codex/get-shit-done/
    \`\`\`

    Done. GSD is completely removed.
    ```

    **What Gets Removed:**

    1. **Skills:** All `gsd-*` skill directories (29 skills)
    2. **Agents:** All `gsd-*.agent.md` files (13 agents)
    3. **Shared Directory:** `get-shit-done/` folder (references, templates, manifest)

    **Verification:**

    After uninstall, verify removal:
    ```bash
    # Check if GSD files still exist
    ls ~/.claude/get-shit-done/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Removed"
    ls .github/get-shit-done/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Removed"
    ls ~/.codex/get-shit-done/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Removed"
    ```

    **Partial Removal:**

    To remove specific platforms only, delete that platform's directories:
    ```bash
    # Remove only Claude installation
    rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/gsd-* ~/.claude/agents/gsd-* ~/.claude/get-shit-done/
    ```

    **Reinstalling:**

    To reinstall after removal:
    ```bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi
    ```

    Installer treats it as a fresh installation.

    **Notes:**
    - No automatic uninstall command (planned for v2.1+)
    - Deleting directories is safe (templates are static files)
    - Your projects' `.planning/` directories are NOT affected

    Create docs/what-gets-installed.md explaining file structure:

    **Overview:**
    ```markdown
    # What Gets Installed

    When you run `npx get-shit-done-multi`, the installer copies three types of files to your platform directory:

    1. **Skills** (29 files) - Commands you invoke (e.g., `/gsd-plan-phase`)
    2. **Agents** (13 files) - Specialized sub-agents (e.g., gsd-executor)
    3. **Shared Directory** (1 folder) - References, templates, workflows

    Total size: Approximately 2MB
    ```

    **Skills (29 total):**

    List all 29 skills with brief descriptions:

    **Core Workflow:**
    - `/gsd-new-project` - Start new project with research and roadmap
    - `/gsd-new-milestone` - Add new milestone to existing project
    - `/gsd-plan-phase` - Create execution plans for a phase
    - `/gsd-execute-phase` - Execute plans with atomic commits
    - `/gsd-verify-phase` - Verify phase goals achieved
    - (continue for all 29 skills)

    **File Structure:**
    ```
    [platform]/skills/gsd-new-project/SKILL.md
    [platform]/skills/gsd-plan-phase/SKILL.md
    [platform]/skills/gsd-execute-phase/SKILL.md
    ...
    ```

    Each skill has frontmatter:
    - `name`: Display name
    - `description`: What it does
    - `allowed-tools`: Tools Claude can use
    - `argument-hint`: Expected arguments

    **Agents (13 total):**

    List all 13 agents with brief descriptions:

    - `gsd-executor` - Executes plans with atomic commits
    - `gsd-planner` - Creates phase plans
    - `gsd-verifier` - Verifies goal achievement
    - `gsd-researcher` - Researches domains/libraries
    - (continue for all 13 agents)

    **File Structure:**
    ```
    [platform]/agents/gsd-executor.agent.md
    [platform]/agents/gsd-planner.agent.md
    [platform]/agents/gsd-verifier.agent.md
    ...
    ```

    Each agent has frontmatter:
    - `name`: Unique identifier
    - `description`: When to delegate
    - `tools`: Comma-separated tools
    - `skills`: Pre-loaded skills (Claude only)

    **Shared Directory:**

    ```
    [platform]/get-shit-done/
    ├── references/
    │   ├── commit-guidelines.md
    │   ├── planning-protocols.md
    │   └── verification-standards.md
    ├── templates/
    │   └── (plan templates)
    ├── workflows/
    │   └── (workflow helpers)
    └── .gsd-install-manifest.json
    ```

    **Installation Manifest:**

    `.gsd-install-manifest.json` tracks:
    - `gsd_version`: Installed version (e.g., "2.0.0")
    - `platform`: "claude", "copilot", or "codex"
    - `scope`: "global" or "local"
    - `installed_at`: ISO timestamp
    - `files`: Array of all installed files (sorted)

    Used for update detection and version tracking.

    **Platform-Specific Locations:**

    | Platform | Local | Global |
    |----------|-------|--------|
    | Claude | `.claude/` | `~/.claude/` |
    | Copilot | `.github/` | `~/.copilot/` |
    | Codex | `.codex/` | `~/.codex/` |

    Create docs/troubleshooting.md with common issues and solutions:

    **Structure:**

    For each common issue, use format:
    - Problem (exact error message)
    - Symptoms (how user experiences it)
    - Cause (why it happens)
    - Solutions (ranked best to worst)

    **Common Issues:**

    1. **Error: Permission denied (EACCES)**
       - Symptoms: Installation fails with "permission denied"
       - Cause: No write permissions to target directory
       - Solutions:
         1. Use `--local` flag (recommended)
         2. Fix permissions: `chmod -R u+w ~/.claude/`
         3. Use sudo (not recommended)

    2. **Error: Insufficient disk space**
       - Symptoms: Pre-flight validation fails
       - Cause: Less than 2MB available on target disk
       - Solutions:
         1. Free up disk space
         2. Install to different location with `--local`

    3. **Error: Platform not detected**
       - Symptoms: "No platforms found" message
       - Cause: Claude/Copilot/Codex not installed or not in PATH
       - Solutions:
         1. Install your AI platform first
         2. Use explicit flag: `--claude`, `--copilot`, or `--codex`

    4. **Error: Existing installation conflict**
       - Symptoms: Pre-flight validation warns about existing files
       - Cause: Previous GSD installation exists
       - Solutions:
         1. Upgrade by continuing installation (overwrites)
         2. Uninstall first, then reinstall (see [How to Uninstall](how-to-uninstall.md))

    5. **Error: Path resolution failed (Windows)**
       - Symptoms: Installation fails on Windows
       - Cause: Windows path separators or reserved names
       - Solutions:
         1. Use forward slashes in custom paths
         2. Avoid Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, etc.)

    6. **Error: Symlink permission prompt**
       - Symptoms: Interactive prompt about symlinks
       - Cause: Target path contains symlink
       - Solutions:
         1. Approve if symlink is intentional
         2. Reject and use non-symlinked path
         3. Use `--yes` to skip prompts (auto-approve)

    7. **Installation succeeds but commands not working**
       - Symptoms: `/gsd-*` commands not recognized
       - Cause: Platform didn't reload skills
       - Solutions:
         1. Restart your AI platform
         2. Check installation location matches platform config
         3. Verify files exist: `ls ~/.claude/skills/gsd-*`

    8. **Update detection not working**
       - Symptoms: `--version` doesn't show installations
       - Cause: Missing or corrupted manifest files
       - Solutions:
         1. Check manifest exists: `cat ~/.claude/get-shit-done/.gsd-install-manifest.json`
         2. Reinstall to regenerate manifest

    **Getting Help:**

    If none of these solutions work:
    1. Check error log: `.gsd-error.log` in installation directory
    2. Open GitHub issue with:
       - Error message (full output)
       - Environment (Node version, OS, platform)
       - Steps to reproduce
    3. Include manifest file: `.gsd-install-manifest.json`

    **Next Steps:**
    - See [How to Install](how-to-install.md) for fresh installation
    - See [How to Uninstall](how-to-uninstall.md) for cleanup
