# Phase 6 Plan 3: README & Release Prep

**Update README for multi-platform architecture and prepare v2.0.0 release**

## Objective

Update README.md to reflect v2.0 multi-platform capabilities, create complete CHANGELOG.md 2.0.0 entry, and bump package.json to v2.0.0.

## Context

**Current README:**
- Focuses on multi-CLI support (Claude, Copilot, Codex)
- Installation section shows basic npx commands
- Needs update for template system and platform optimization

**v2.0.0 Major Changes:**
- Template-based agent generation (breaking change from static agents)
- Platform-specific optimization (Claude vs Copilot formats)
- Zero-warnings installation workflow
- Complete test coverage (208 tests)
- Architecture and contributing documentation

**Goal:**
README clearly communicates v2.0 capabilities. Release artifacts ready for npm publish.

## Tasks

<task name="update-readme" type="auto">
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md to reflect v2.0 multi-platform architecture.

Changes:
1. **Add "What's New in v2.0" section** (after "What It Does", before "Quick Start")
   ```markdown
   ## What's New in v2.0 🚀
   
   **Major Release:** Template-based multi-platform optimization
   
   - **Platform Optimization** — Each CLI gets agents optimized for its spec (Claude: string tools, Copilot: array tools + PRIMARY aliases)
   - **Single Source of Truth** — Agents generated from specs/agents/ templates (no drift between platforms)
   - **Zero Warnings** — Installation workflow validates against official platform specs
   - **Complete Testing** — 208 tests validate generation, installation, and invocation
   - **Better Maintainability** — Edit one spec, generate optimized agents for all platforms
   
   **Breaking Change:** Agents now generated during installation. See [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md) if upgrading from v1.x.
   ```

2. **Update Installation section** - Expand to explain platform optimization:
   ```markdown
   ### Install
   
   GSD generates agents optimized for each platform during installation:
   
   ```bash
   # Claude Code (uppercase tools, string format)
   npx get-shit-done-multi
   
   # GitHub Copilot CLI (PRIMARY aliases: execute, edit, search, agent)
   npx get-shit-done-multi --copilot
   
   # Codex CLI (optimized for OpenAI)
   npx get-shit-done-multi --codex
   ```
   
   **New in v2.0:** Agents are generated from templates with platform-specific optimization. Re-run install to regenerate agents.
   ```

3. **Add Architecture section** (after "Quick Start", before rest of content)
   ```markdown
   ## Architecture
   
   GSD uses template-based generation to optimize agents for each platform:
   
   - **Spec-as-Template** — Single source in `specs/agents/` with Mustache conditionals
   - **Platform Abstraction** — Tool mapping, field transformation, validation
   - **Install-Time Generation** — No runtime overhead, each CLI gets optimal format
   
   **Technical Details:** See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
   **Contributing:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
   **Upgrading from v1.x:** See [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md)
   ```

4. **Update "Supported Platforms" badge** - Change to reflect v2.0:
   Change from:
   ```
   **Supported Platforms:** Claude Code · GitHub Copilot CLI · Codex CLI
   ```
   To:
   ```
   **v2.0 Multi-Platform:** Template-based optimization for Claude Code · GitHub Copilot CLI · Codex CLI
   ```

5. **Add Documentation section** (near bottom, before License/Attribution)
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation
   
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — Technical design and platform abstraction
   - [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — How to add agents and contribute
   - [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md) — Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0
   - [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — Common errors and solutions
   - [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — Version history and release notes
   - [docs/TESTING-CROSS-PLATFORM.md](docs/TESTING-CROSS-PLATFORM.md) — Testing workflow
   - [docs/AGENT-SPLIT-PATTERN.md](docs/AGENT-SPLIT-PATTERN.md) — Size optimization pattern
   ```

```markdown
## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-22

**BREAKING CHANGES:** Agents now generated from templates during installation. See [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md) for upgrade guide.

### Added
- Template-based agent generation system with platform-specific optimization
- Platform abstraction layer (tool-mapper, field-transformer, validators)
- Bidirectional tool mapping accepting all tool name variants
- PRIMARY Copilot aliases (execute, edit, search, agent) for spec compliance
- Zero-warnings installation workflow validation
- Comprehensive test suite (208 tests: 64 tool-mapper, 20 field-transformer, 32 validators, 26 integration, 22 generation, 5 installation, smoke tests)
- E2E test orchestration (generation → installation → invocation)
- npm test scripts (test, test:generation, test:installation, test:invocation)
- ARCHITECTURE.md documenting template system and platform abstraction
- CONTRIBUTING.md with agent creation workflow and testing guide
- MIGRATION-V2.md for v1.x → v2.0 upgrade path
- Agent splitting pattern for Copilot 30K size limit (gsd-planner, gsd-debugger)

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Agents generated from specs/agents/ templates (not static files)
- **BREAKING:** Custom agent edits must be made in specs/agents/ (not agents/)
- Tool references use platform-specific names (Bash for Claude, execute for Copilot)
- Copilot agents use PRIMARY aliases (execute, edit, search, agent) not compatible aliases
- Claude agents use string tools format ("Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Task")
- Copilot agents use array tools format ([execute, edit, search, agent])
- Metadata structure platform-specific (Claude: none, Copilot: nested under metadata object)
- Re-running install is idempotent (safely overwrites generated agents)

### Technical
- Spec-as-template format with Mustache conditionals for platform sections
- Generation pipeline: parse → render → transform → validate → write
- Platform capability flags control conditional rendering
- REVERSE_INDEX for bidirectional tool name lookup
- Validation against official platform specs (Claude and Copilot)
- Cross-platform testing with actual CLI invocation

### Migration Notes
- **Action Required:** Existing v1.x users must regenerate agents
- Run `npx get-shit-done-multi` to regenerate (preserves .planning/ state)
- Custom agents: Move edits from agents/ to specs/agents/ and regenerate
- Agent functionality unchanged (behavior identical, only format optimized)
- See [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md) for detailed upgrade guide

### Documentation
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — Template system and platform abstraction design
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — How to add agents and contribute
- [MIGRATION-V2.md](docs/MIGRATION-V2.md) — v1.x → v2.0 upgrade guide
- [docs/TESTING-CROSS-PLATFORM.md](docs/TESTING-CROSS-PLATFORM.md) — Testing workflow

### Acknowledgments
This release represents 5 phases of work:
- Phase 1: Template Engine Foundation (gray-matter + Mustache)
- Phase 2: Platform Abstraction Layer (tool-mapper, field-transformer, validators)
- Phase 3: Spec Migration (11 agents → spec-as-template format)
- Phase 4: Installation Integration (zero-warnings workflow)
- Phase 5: Cross-Platform Testing (208 tests, E2E validation)

Update package.json version to 2.0.0.

Change line 3:
FROM: "version": "1.8.1",
TO:   "version": "2.0.0",

This is a MAJOR version bump because:
- Breaking change: Agents now generated (not static)
- Breaking change: Custom edits must be in specs/agents/ (not agents/)
- Major architectural change: Template system
- Major enhancement: Platform-specific optimization

Semantic versioning justification:
- MAJOR (2.0.0): Breaking changes in how agents are managed
- Not MINOR: Would be if backward compatible
- Not PATCH: Would be if bug fixes only

    <command>grep '"version": "2.0.0"' package.json</command>
