# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 08-documentation-and-release
    provides: Core documentation files (migration guide, troubleshooting, command comparison)
  - phase: 8.1-01-migration-mechanism
    provides: Migration infrastructure and file naming conventions
provides:
  - Simplified README with index-style documentation section
  - Restructured CHANGELOG with User Changes / GSD Internal Logic sections
  - Updated setup guides with current directory structure trees
  - Verified troubleshooting guide uses static format
affects: [release, v1.9.1, user-onboarding]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "CHANGELOG two-section format (User Changes + GSD Internal Logic)"
    - "README index-style documentation (links, not comprehensive content)"
    - "Setup docs show visual directory trees with file counts"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - README.md
    - CHANGELOG.md
    - docs/setup-claude-code.md
    - docs/setup-copilot-cli.md
    - docs/setup-codex-cli.md

key-decisions:
  - "README DOCUMENTATION section is index-style with links (comprehensive content stays in docs/)"
  - "CHANGELOG uses two sections per version: User Changes (user-facing) and GSD Internal Logic (contributor-facing)"
  - "BREAKING changes appear only once in User Changes section (no duplication)"
  - "Setup docs show directory tree structure with file count expectations"
  - "Troubleshooting.md uses static /gsd- format (no template syntax)"
  - "command-system.md already removed (no action needed)"

patterns-established:
  - "User documentation focuses on outcomes, not implementation details"
  - "README is navigation hub, not comprehensive manual"
  - "CHANGELOG separates user-visible changes from internal technical details"

# Phase 8.1 Plan 02: Documentation Content Updates Summary

**Simplified README with index-style docs, restructured CHANGELOG with user/contributor sections, updated setup guides with current directory structures**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min 9 sec
- **Started:** 2026-01-24T11:26:03Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24T11:29:12Z
- **Tasks:** 6 (5 content tasks + 1 commit task)
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Simplified README.md with index-style DOCUMENTATION section (links to detailed guides)
- Restructured CHANGELOG.md v1.9.1 entry with User Changes and GSD Internal Logic sections
- Updated all three setup guides (Claude, Copilot, Codex) with visual directory trees and file count expectations
- Verified troubleshooting.md uses static /gsd- format (no template syntax)
- Confirmed command-system.md already removed (no references remain)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Simplify README.md** - `69d2455` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Restructure CHANGELOG.md** - `69d2455` (docs)
3. **Task 3: Update setup documentation** - `69d2455` (docs)
4. **Task 4: Verify troubleshooting.md format** - `69d2455` (docs)
5. **Task 5: Remove command-system.md** - N/A (already removed)
6. **Task 6: Commit documentation content updates** - `69d2455` (docs)

_Note: All tasks batched into single commit as they're related documentation updates_

## Files Created/Modified

- `README.md` - Simplified with index-style docs section, removed "GitHub PRIMARY" reference, kept Quick Start inline
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Restructured v1.9.1 with User Changes and GSD Internal Logic sections, BREAKING only in User Changes
- `docs/setup-claude-code.md` - Added directory tree structure, file count expectations, removed old nested structure references
- `docs/setup-copilot-cli.md` - Added directory tree structure, file count expectations for Copilot
- `docs/setup-codex-cli.md` - Added directory tree structure, file count expectations for Codex

## Decisions Made

**README Structure:**
- DOCUMENTATION section is index-style (links to detailed docs, not comprehensive content inline)
- Platform-neutral language ("for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Codex CLI" not "GitHub PRIMARY")
- Quick Start remains inline for immediate usability

**CHANGELOG Format:**
- Two-section format per version: User Changes (user-facing) and GSD Internal Logic (technical/contributor)
- BREAKING changes appear only in User Changes (no duplication across sections)
- User Changes are outcome-focused, GSD Internal Logic includes technical details

**Setup Docs:**
- Visual directory tree structure showing exact paths (not prose descriptions)
- File count expectations listed (29 skills, 11 agents) for verification
- No references to old nested structure (commands/gsd/)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verified static /gsd- format (no {{cmdPrefix}} template syntax)
- Platform-specific sections exist (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Codex CLI)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

**Task 5 (Remove command-system.md):** File already removed in previous ad-hoc maintenance work. No references found in current documentation. Verified and marked complete.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Documentation content is clean and consistent:
- README is now a navigation hub (not comprehensive manual)
- CHANGELOG clearly separates user-visible from internal changes
- Setup guides show current directory structure (skills/agents not commands/)
- All platform-specific docs verified

Ready for Plan 03 (link validation and script audit).
