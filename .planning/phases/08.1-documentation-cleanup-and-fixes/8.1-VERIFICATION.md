### Human Verification Required

None - All verifications completed programmatically.

### Gap Closure Summary

**Previous Verification (2026-01-24T16:00:00Z):**
- Status: gaps_found
- Score: 21/25 must-haves verified
- 4 gaps identified

**Gap Closure Plan (8.1-05) Addressed:**

1. **✅ Gap 1: SVG asset outdated (BLOCKER)**
   - **Issue:** terminal.svg showed 'get-shit-done-cc' instead of 'get-shit-done-multi --copilot'
   - **Fixed:** SVG updated with correct command, version, and generic description
   - **Verification:** `grep "get-shit-done-multi --copilot" assets/terminal.svg` ✓

2. **✅ Gap 2: .gitignore not pre-populated (WARNING)**
   - **Issue:** .old-gsd-system/ added dynamically during migration, not pre-added
   - **Fixed:** .gitignore now contains .old-gsd-system/ on line 48
   - **Verification:** `grep ".old-gsd-system/" .gitignore` ✓

3. **✅ Gap 3: Module location mismatch (DOCUMENTATION)**
   - **Issue:** PLAN specified scripts/migration/*.js but actual location is bin/lib/migration/
   - **Resolution:** Accepted as intentional architectural decision
   - **Rationale:** bin/ is self-contained with zero dependencies on scripts/
   - **Verification:** Migration modules exist and are fully functional in bin/lib/migration/

4. **✅ Gap 4: Missing rename script (DOCUMENTATION)**
   - **Issue:** PLAN specified scripts/documentation/rename-to-lowercase.js but doesn't exist
   - **Resolution:** Accepted - renaming was done via git mv commands, not separate script
   - **Verification:** All docs/*.md files are lowercase, git history shows proper renames

**Current Verification (2026-01-24T17:00:00Z):**
- Status: passed
- Score: 25/25 must-haves verified
- All gaps closed or documented as intentional design

## Re-verification Notes

### Changes Since Previous Verification

**Code Changes (Plan 8.1-05):**
1. Updated assets/terminal.svg with current install command
2. Pre-populated .gitignore with .old-gsd-system/

**Documentation (Plan 8.1-05):**
3. Accepted bin/lib/migration/ location as intentional design
4. Accepted git mv approach instead of separate rename script

### Regression Check

**No regressions detected.** All 21 previously verified must-haves still pass, plus 4 new verifications.

### Phase Goal Achievement

**Goal:** Refine documentation structure, fix inconsistencies, and implement proper migration mechanism

**Achievement:**
- ✅ **Documentation structure refined:** README index-style, CHANGELOG two-section format, setup docs with trees
- ✅ **Inconsistencies fixed:** SVG updated, lowercase files, no GitHub PRIMARY references
- ✅ **Migration mechanism implemented:** Auto-detection, backup, progress bar, user prompts all functional

**Verification Score: 25/25 (100%)**

All observable truths verified. All artifacts exist, are substantive, and are wired. All key links connected. No blockers. Phase goal fully achieved.
