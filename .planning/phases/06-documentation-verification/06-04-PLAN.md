Create comprehensive implementation differences guide explaining what works differently per CLI.

**Structure:**

# Implementation Differences

## Overview
Brief explanation of why differences exist (CLI architecture, capabilities).

## Command System Differences
- **Claude Code**: Skills with native `/gsd:*` syntax
- **Copilot CLI**: Skills with `/gsd:*` syntax via GitHub integration
- **Codex CLI**: Skills with `/gsd:*` syntax, prompts in `.codex/prompts/`

## Agent System Differences
- **Claude Code**: Native agents in `.claude/agents/`
- **Copilot CLI**: Custom agents in `.github/agents/`
- **Codex CLI**: Agent-like behavior via skills (no native agent support)

## Installation Paths
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/get-shit-done/` (global), `.claude/get-shit-done/` (local)
- **Copilot CLI**: `.github/skills/get-shit-done/` (local only)
- **Codex CLI**: `~/.codex/skills/get-shit-done/` (global), `.codex/skills/get-shit-done/` (local)

## State Management
- All CLIs use same `.planning/` directory structure
- Concurrent usage supported via directory locking
- Session persistence enables CLI switching

## Performance Characteristics
- Include data from Phase 4 performance tracking if available
- Execution time comparisons for typical operations
- Context window sizes and limitations

## Feature Availability
- Reference cli-comparison.md for detailed feature matrix
- Call out major limitations per CLI
- Link to capability-matrix.html for interactive exploration

Include code examples showing differences, cross-reference other docs.

Create three setup guides following consistent structure for each CLI.

**Template structure (customize per CLI):**

# Getting Started with GSD in [CLI Name]

## Prerequisites
- [CLI] installed and authenticated
- Node.js 16.7.0 or higher
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

## Installation

### Local Installation (Project-Specific)
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/project

# Install GSD for [CLI]
npx get-shit-done-cc --[cli]
```

### Global Installation
```bash
# Install globally for [CLI]
npx get-shit-done-cc --[cli]-global
```

## Verification
```bash
# Run verification command
/gsd:verify-installation
```

Expected output: ✓ [CLI] installed, ✓ Skills registered, ✓ Commands available

## Your First Command
```bash
# Create a new project
/gsd:new-project
```

## Key Differences for [CLI]
- [CLI-specific notes from implementation-differences.md]
- Common gotchas
- Performance tips

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions (link to troubleshooting.md).

## Next Steps
- Read [implementation-differences.md](implementation-differences.md)
- Explore [CLI comparison](cli-comparison.md)
- Try [capability matrix](capability-matrix.html)

**CLI-specific customizations:**

**setup-claude-code.md:**
- Note: Global path is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude` on Mac
- Native agent support - fastest execution
- Best for solo developers

**setup-copilot-cli.md:**
- Note: Local only installation (no global)
- GitHub integration - requires `gh` CLI
- Best for team workflows

**setup-codex-cli.md:**
- Note: Skills-based architecture
- OpenAI ecosystem integration
- Global and local support

Include real commands, expected outputs, platform-specific notes.

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Navigation by Symptom
| Symptom | CLI | Section |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Command not found | All | [Installation Issues](#installation-issues) |
| Permission denied | All | [Permission Issues](#permission-issues) |
| Skill not detected | Claude | [Claude Code Issues](#claude-code-issues) |
| GitHub auth failed | Copilot | [Copilot CLI Issues](#copilot-cli-issues) |
| Agent timeout | All | [Agent Issues](#agent-issues) |

## Installation Issues
### Command not found
**Symptom:** Running `/gsd:*` shows "command not found"
**Diagnosis:** Run `/gsd:verify-installation`
**Solutions:**
1. Check installation: [commands by CLI]
2. If missing, reinstall: [commands]
3. If present but not working: [CLI-specific fixes]

### Permission denied
[Follow research pattern with diagnosis, solutions, root cause, prevention]

## CLI-Specific Issues
### Claude Code Issues
- Skill not loading
- Path resolution errors on Windows
- Agent delegation failures

### Copilot CLI Issues
- GitHub authentication required
- Skill refresh needed
- Custom agent not recognized

### Codex CLI Issues
- Skill registration
- Prompt directory setup
- OpenAI API configuration

## State Management Issues
- Concurrent CLI usage conflicts
- `.planning/` directory corruption
- State migration failures

**migration-guide.md structure:**

# Migration Guide: Single-CLI to Multi-CLI

## Why Multi-CLI?
- Flexibility: Use best CLI for each task
- Resilience: Fallback options if one CLI unavailable
- Learning: Compare approaches across CLIs

## Current State Assessment
1. Run `/gsd:verify-installation` to see current setup
2. Identify which CLI you're using
3. Check `.planning/` directory exists

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install Additional CLIs
```bash
# Add Copilot CLI if you have Claude
npx get-shit-done-cc --copilot

# Or install all at once
npx get-shit-done-cc --all
```

### Step 2: Verify Multi-CLI Setup
```bash
/gsd:verify-installation
```
Should show multiple CLIs detected.

### Step 3: Test CLI Switching
```bash
# In Claude Code
/gsd:new-project

# Switch to Copilot CLI
/gsd:plan-phase 1

# Verify state preserved
cat .planning/STATE.md
```

## Common Migration Issues
[Troubleshooting scenarios specific to migration]

## Best Practices
- Keep all CLIs on same GSD version
- Use `.planning/config.json` for CLI preferences
- Run verification after each CLI installation

Follow research patterns, include real commands and expected outputs.
