# Phase 6.1: Old Version Detection & Migration (INSERTED)

**Status:** 🔵 Ready to Plan  
**Type:** Urgent insertion - Discovered during Phase 6 completion  
**Goal:** Detect old v1.x installations, offer upgrade with automatic backup, and install v2.0.0

---

## Why This Phase Was Inserted

During Phase 6 (Update Detection) completion, we discovered that v2.0.0 has a **completely incompatible structure** with v1.x installations. Users with v1.x cannot upgrade without migration.

**Critical issue:** Without detection and migration, users will experience:
- Silent installation failures
- Mixed old/new file structures
- Broken workflows
- Confusion about what went wrong

**This blocks successful v2.0.0 adoption** for existing v1.x users.

---

## Old vs New Structure

### Old Structure (v1.x)
- **Claude:** `.claude/commands/gsd/` (30+ files), `.claude/hooks/` (3 files), single `VERSION` file
- **Copilot:** `.github/skills/get-shit-done/` (monolithic), single `VERSION` file  
- **Codex:** `.codex/skills/get-shit-done/` (monolithic), single `VERSION` file

### New Structure (v2.0.0)
- **All platforms:** Individual skills `gsd-*/`, per-skill `version.json`, no hooks
- **Agent naming:** All use `.agent.md` suffix (Claude was `.md` only in v1.x)

**Reference:** See `06.1-RESEARCH.md` for detailed structural analysis

## Discussion Decisions

**Discussed:** 2026-01-28  
**Areas:** Migration Prompt Design, Backup Location & Behavior, Error Recovery, Multi-Scope Detection  
**Decisions:** 17 specific implementation decisions captured below

### 1. Migration Prompt Design

**D1.1 - Warning Message Tone**
- **Style:** User-friendly and actionable (not technical)
- **Content:** "⚠ Old version detected (v1.8.0). Your installation is outdated and incompatible with v2.0.0. We'll create a safe backup and install the new version."

**D1.2 - Confirmation Options**
- **Choices:** Simple Yes/No
  - [Yes, create backup and upgrade]
  - [No, exit]
- No multi-step or preview options

**D1.3 - Information Density**
- **Show detailed steps:**
  ```
  What will happen:
    1. Backup v1.8.0 to [path]/.gsd-backup/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/
    2. Remove old files
    3. Install v2.0.0
  ```

**D1.4 - Flow Timing**
- **Sequence:** Banner → **Check old version** → Migration (if needed) → Regular installation
- Old version check happens BEFORE platform detection or any other flow
- If no old version: skip entirely, proceed to regular installation

### 2. Backup Location & Behavior

**D2.1 - Backup Directory Structure**
- **Location:** `[current-folder]/.gsd-backup/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/`
- NOT in home directory (~/)
- Stays in same directory as installation (global/local/custom-path)
- Preserves original structure inside backup

**D2.2 - Multiple Backups Handling**
- **Strategy:** Just add new backup, user handles cleanup manually
- No auto-deletion of old backups
- No limit on number of backups
- Example: `.gsd-backup/2026-01-27-1430/`, `.gsd-backup/2026-01-28-0900/`, etc.

**D2.3 - Disk Space Validation**
- **Approach:** Check before backup, abort if insufficient
- Show clear error: "Backup requires ~150MB, Available: 45MB"
- Exit without attempting backup

**D2.4 - Completion Message**
- **Style:** Simple confirmation
- **Format:** "✓ Backup created: .gsd-backup/2026-01-28-1400/. You can delete this manually after verifying the installation."
- No detailed file list or size information

### 3. Error Recovery Scenarios

**D3.1 - Backup Fails (Permissions/I/O)**
- **Action:** Abort everything, no changes made
- **Message:** "✗ Backup failed: [reason]. Your v1.8.0 installation is unchanged. Please fix [issue] and try again."
- Exit cleanly, preserve old installation

**D3.2 - Partial Backup (Some Files Fail)**
- **Strategy:** Retry failed files up to 3 times
- **Fallback:** Keep partial backup, cancel installation
- **Message:** "⚠ Backup incomplete: 142/145 files backed up. Partial backup saved to: [path]. Installation cancelled."

**D3.3 - Migration Module Independence**
- **Constraint:** Migration module is INDEPENDENT
- Does NOT modify or interfere with regular installation behavior
- CAN reuse existing functions but CANNOT modify them without explicit approval
- Should be in separate directory (e.g., `bin/lib/migration/`)

**D3.4 - Migration Completion Message**
- **Message:** "Old version backed up. Now ready to install latest version."
- Simple transition before regular installation starts
- No fancy formatting, just clear statement

**D3.5 - User Interruption (Ctrl+C)**
- **Behavior:** Immediate exit wherever we are
- No cleanup of partial operations
- Accept partial state (partial backup, partial removal)

### 4. Multi-Scope Detection

**D4.1 - Multiple Scopes (Global + Local)**
- **Approach:** Warn about both, migrate requested scope only
- **Message:** "⚠ Multiple old installations detected: • Local: v1.8.0 • Global: v1.8.0. We'll migrate the local installation now. After this, run again with --global to migrate global installation."
- Handle one scope per run

**D4.2 - Multiple Platforms at Different Versions**
- **Show only old versions** (don't validate or show v2.0.0 installations)
- **Message:** "⚠ Old versions detected: • GitHub Copilot: v1.8.0 • Codex CLI: v1.7.0"
- **Action:** Migrate all old platforms in sequence with single confirmation

**D4.3 - Custom-Path Backup Location**
- **Location:** Same as standard - `[custom-path]/.gsd-backup/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/`
- Not in home directory
- Consistent behavior across all installation types

**D4.4 - Mixed Old/New Same Platform**
- **Scenario:** Global v1.8.0, Local v2.0.0 (or vice versa)
- **Approach:** Suggest consistency, warn about confusion
- **Message:** "⚠ Version mismatch detected: • Global: v1.8.0 (old) • Local: v2.0.0 (current). This may cause confusion. Recommend migrating global to v2.0.0."

## Migration Flow

User experience when running installer with v1.x detected:

```
1. Detect old version (e.g., v1.8.0)
   ↓
2. Show warning:
   "Version 1.8.0 detected (incompatible with v2.0.0)"
   "Would you like to:"
   " - Create backup of v1.8.0"
   " - Install v2.0.0"
   
   [Yes, upgrade] [No, exit]
   ↓
3a. User confirms:
    - Create ~/.gsd-backup/v1.8.0-20260128-0142/
    - Move all old files to backup
    - Show: "Backup saved to: [path]"
    - Show: "You can delete manually after verifying"
    - Continue with v2.0.0 installation
    
3b. User declines:
    - Show: "Installation cancelled"
    - Show: "v1.x is incompatible with v2.0.0"
    - Exit cleanly
```

---

## Requirements

### Detection (R1-R3)
1. Detect old v1.x installations across all 3 platforms
2. Support detection in global (`~/`), local (`.`), and custom-path scopes
3. Read version from old structure (single VERSION file)

### User Experience (R4-R8)
4. Clear warning message about incompatibility
5. Single confirmation prompt for upgrade
6. Automatic backup creation (no manual steps)
7. Clear messaging about backup location and manual deletion
8. Graceful exit with explanation if user declines

### Backup (R9-R12)
9. Backup directory: `~/.gsd-backup/v{version}-{timestamp}/`
10. Preserve all old files (commands, agents, hooks, settings)
11. Atomic backup operation (all or nothing)
12. Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` (sortable)

### Installation (R13-R15)
13. Continue with regular v2.0.0 installation after backup
14. No mixing of old and new structures
15. Verify backup succeeded before deleting source

### Error Handling (R16-R18)
16. Handle backup failures gracefully
17. Don't delete old files if backup fails
18. Show clear error messages with recovery steps

---

## Technical Approach

### Module 1: Old Version Detector

**Location:** `bin/lib/version/old-version-detector.js`

**Functions:**
```javascript
export async function detectOldVersion(platform, targetDir)
// Returns: { isOld: boolean, version: string, paths: string[] }

export async function readOldVersion(platform, targetDir)
// Returns: version string from old VERSION file

export async function getOldInstallationPaths(platform, targetDir)
// Returns: array of paths to backup
```

**Detection Logic:**

| Platform | Primary Marker | Secondary Markers |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Claude | `.claude/get-shit-done/VERSION` | `.claude/commands/gsd/` OR `.claude/hooks/gsd-check-update.js` |
| Copilot | `.github/skills/get-shit-done/VERSION` | `.github/skills/get-shit-done/SKILL.md` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/get-shit-done/VERSION` | `.codex/skills/get-shit-done/SKILL.md` |

### Module 2: Migration Manager

**Location:** `bin/lib/migration/migration-manager.js`

**Functions:**
```javascript
export async function promptMigration(platform, oldVersion)
// Shows warning, gets user confirmation
// Returns: { confirmed: boolean }

export async function createBackupDir(oldVersion)
// Creates ~/.gsd-backup/v{version}-{timestamp}/
// Returns: backup directory path

export async function moveToBackup(sourcePaths, backupDir)
// Moves files atomically
// Returns: { success: boolean, failed: string[] }

export async function showBackupConfirmation(backupPath)
// Displays backup location and manual deletion instructions
```

### Integration Points

1. **Orchestrator pre-check** (`bin/lib/installer/orchestrator.js`)
   - Before `validateVersionBeforeInstall()`
   - If old version detected → run migration flow
   
2. **Interactive mode** (`bin/lib/cli/interactive.js`)
   - After platform detection
   - Before platform/scope prompts
   
3. **Check-updates** (`bin/lib/updater/check-update.js`)
   - Detect old versions
   - Show special incompatibility message

---

## Files to Modify

- `bin/lib/installer/orchestrator.js` - Add pre-installation migration check
- `bin/lib/cli/interactive.js` - Add migration prompt before platform selection
- `bin/lib/updater/check-update.js` - Detect and warn about old versions
- `bin/lib/updater/update-messages.js` - Add old version incompatibility message

## Files to Create

- `bin/lib/version/old-version-detector.js` - Detection logic
- `bin/lib/migration/migration-manager.js` - Migration and backup logic
- `tests/unit/old-version-detector.test.js` - Detector tests
- `tests/unit/migration-manager.test.js` - Migration tests
- `tests/integration/migration-flow.test.js` - End-to-end migration tests

---

## Dependencies

- Existing: `fs-extra` (file operations)
- Existing: `@clack/prompts` (confirmation dialog)
- Existing: `path` (directory resolution)
- No new packages required

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Multiple scopes:** User has v1.x in both global and local
   - Solution: Detect and migrate each scope independently
   
2. **Partial installation:** Some platforms v1.x, others v2.x
   - Solution: Only migrate platforms with old versions
   
3. **Backup already exists:** `~/.gsd-backup/v1.8.0-*` directory exists
   - Solution: Add timestamp suffix to make unique
   
4. **Disk space:** Not enough space for backup
   - Solution: Check space before backup, show clear error
   
5. **Permissions:** Can't create backup directory
   - Solution: Show permission error, suggest sudo or different location

---

## Notes

- Phase inserted as **6.1** because it's urgent work that must happen before Phase 7
- Backup location in home directory avoids conflicts with project directories
- Migration is **one-way** (v1.x → v2.0.0), no downgrade support
- Claude-specific: `settings.json` hooks configuration included in backup
- Manual deletion of backup gives users time to verify new installation works
