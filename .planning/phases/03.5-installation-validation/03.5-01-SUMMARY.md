# Plan 03.5-01: Enhanced Installation Logging - Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completed:** 2026-01-23  
**Type:** implementation  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

---

## Objective

Add detailed logging to install.js so users can see exactly where skills were installed and what was created.

---

## Problem Addressed

User reported: "No veo las carpetas de skills después de ejecutar --copilot"

**Root cause:** Skills WERE being created, but no feedback showed:
- WHERE they were installed (absolute paths)
- WHAT was created (list of skills)
- HOW to verify (commands to check)

User had to manually navigate and search for skills directory.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to bin/install.js (lines 908-931)

Added enhanced logging after skill generation with:

1. **Absolute path display**
   - Shows full path to skills directory
   - Works for all 3 platforms (Claude, Copilot, Codex)

2. **Skill list with sizes**
   - Each generated skill shown with checkmark
   - File size displayed for verification (ensures not empty)
   - Indented for readability

3. **Verification command**
   - Suggests `ls` command with exact path
   - User can immediately verify installation

### Output Example

```
✓ Skills: 4 generated at /tmp/test-enhanced/.github/skills
    ✓ gsd-execute-phase/ (11.0 KB)
    ✓ gsd-help/ (11.0 KB)
    ✓ gsd-new-milestone/ (19.3 KB)
    ✓ gsd-new-project/ (24.5 KB)
  Verify with: ls /tmp/test-enhanced/.github/skills
```

## Implementation Details

**File modified:** `bin/install.js`  
**Lines added:** 23  
**Approach:** Non-invasive (add logging, don't change logic)

### Code Structure

1. After `generateSkillsFromSpecs()` completes
2. Get skill directory for current platform
3. Read directory contents and file sizes
4. Format output with colors and indentation
5. Display verification command

### Platform Support

- ✅ Claude Code: `.claude/skills`
- ✅ GitHub Copilot CLI: `.github/skills`
- ✅ Codex CLI: `.codex/skills`

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Fresh installation to /tmp
```bash
node bin/install.js --copilot --project-dir /tmp/test-enhanced
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS - All paths and skills shown clearly

### Test 2: Workspace installation
```bash
node bin/install.js --copilot
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Current directory paths shown correctly

### Test 3: All platforms
```bash
node bin/install.js --claude --project-dir /tmp/claude-test
node bin/install.js --codex --project-dir /tmp/codex-test
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Each platform shows correct paths

---

## Impact

### Before
- User: "No veo las carpetas"
- Output: "✓ Skills: 4 generated" (no details)
- User must manually search

### After
- Clear absolute paths shown
- Each skill listed with size confirmation
- Verification command provided
- User knows exactly where to look

---

## User Feedback

Problem: User confusion about skill installation location  
Solution: Enhanced visibility and verification  
Result: Issue resolved ✅

---

## Files Modified

- `bin/install.js` (+23 lines, enhanced logging)
