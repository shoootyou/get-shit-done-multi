## Tasks Completed

| 2 | ✅ | 31458d4 | Migrate Claude test files to tests/unit/platforms/claude/ |
| 3 | ✅ | 31458d4 | Update imports in consumer files |
| 4 | ✅ | f7f426c | Validate with install test |

## Work Completed

**Files Migrated:**
- `bin/lib/platforms/claude-adapter.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/claude/adapter.js`
- `bin/lib/frontmatter/claude-validator.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/claude/validator.js`
- `bin/lib/serialization/claude-serializer.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/claude/serializer.js`
- `bin/lib/serialization/claude-cleaner.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/claude/cleaner.js`

**Test Files Migrated:**
- `tests/unit/claude-serializer.test.js` → `tests/unit/platforms/claude/serializer.test.js`

**Imports Updated:**
