## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Create specs in `/specs/skills/` without touching legacy (allows gradual transition)
- Use same spec for 3 platforms (reduces duplication, automatic adaptation)
- Prefix "gsd-" in specs, "gsd:" in legacy (clear differentiation, avoids conflicts)
- Structure of folder per skill (follows Claude standard, enables expansion)
- Metadata format matches `/specs/agents/` (consistency with existing system)
