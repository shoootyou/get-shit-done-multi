title: Update project scope - v2.0.0+ as template system only
area: docs
files:
  - README.md
  - docs/
---

## Problem

Starting from v2.0.0, the project changes focus:
- No more active development of new capabilities/skills/agents
- The installer has achieved its goal: being multi-platform (Codex and Copilot)
- This repo will function as a template system, syncing agents and skills from the original get-shit-done
- Documentation must reflect this scope change and direct users to the original repository to understand GSD in depth

Need to update documentation to clearly communicate:
1. From v2.0.0+: only template synchronization (agents, skills, get-shit-done folder content)
2. No active development of new capabilities
3. Existing docs simplify understanding of GSD, but the original repo is the primary source

## Solution

Update README.md and main documentation to:
- Add clear section about project scope
- Explain that this is a multi-platform template system
- Reference the original get-shit-done repository for deeper understanding
- Mark in changelog/releases that v2.0.0+ is template maintenance
- Potentially add badge or prominent note indicating "Template System"
