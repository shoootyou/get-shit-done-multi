**Phase:** 12.1 - Refactor to per-platform directory structure  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Completed:** 2026-02-01

## Objective

Migrate Copilot platform files from domain-based directories (frontmatter/, serialization/, platforms/) to unified platform directory (platforms/copilot/).

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Status | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | ✅ | 31458d4 | Migrate Copilot source files to platforms/copilot/ |
| 2 | ✅ | 31458d4 | Migrate Copilot test files to tests/unit/platforms/copilot/ |
| 3 | ✅ | 31458d4 | Update imports in consumer files |
| 4 | ✅ | f7f426c | Validate with install test |

## Work Completed

**Files Migrated:**
- `bin/lib/platforms/copilot-adapter.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/copilot/adapter.js`
- `bin/lib/frontmatter/copilot-validator.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/copilot/validator.js`
- `bin/lib/serialization/copilot-serializer.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/copilot/serializer.js`
- `bin/lib/serialization/copilot-cleaner.js` → `bin/lib/platforms/copilot/cleaner.js`

**Test Files Migrated:**
- `tests/unit/copilot-serializer.test.js` → `tests/unit/platforms/copilot/serializer.test.js`

**Imports Updated:**
- Internal imports within Copilot files (adapter → serializer, validator → base-validator)
- Consumer imports in install-skills.js
- Test imports to new paths

**Validation:**
- Install test passed with `--copilot` flag
- All imports resolve correctly
- Git history preserved via `git mv`
