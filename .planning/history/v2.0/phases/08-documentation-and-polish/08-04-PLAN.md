# Phase 08 Plan 04: Architecture & Advanced Documentation

## Objective

Create five documentation files covering GSD concepts, workflow, customization, technical architecture, and documentation index. These files complete the documentation suite with both user-facing and developer-focused content.

## Context

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Two audiences: Users (what-is-gsd, how-gsd-works, how-to-customize) and developers (architecture)
- ASCII diagrams for user docs (universal compatibility)
- Mermaid diagrams for technical docs (GitHub renders, code block on npm)
- Layered structure in each document
- No emojis, professional but friendly tone

**GSD Workflow (from understanding project):**
1. User runs orchestrator command (e.g., `/gsd-plan-phase`)
2. Orchestrator spawns specialized agents (researcher, planner, executor, verifier)
3. Agents work autonomously with specific tools
4. Results captured in .planning/ directory
5. Git commits document progress

**Architecture Patterns (from phases 1-7):**
- Template-based installation (Phase 1)
- Platform adapter pattern (Phase 3)
- Pre-flight validation (Phase 5, 7.1)
- Installation orchestrator (Phase 2)
- Manifest tracking (Phase 6)
- 8-layer path security (Phase 7)

**Customization Options (from REQUIREMENTS.md):**
- Custom paths (not yet implemented, but mention in docs)
- Local vs global installation
- Platform selection
- Multi-platform support

## Tasks

    # What is GSD?

    **Get Shit Done (GSD)** is a spec-driven development workflow for AI coding assistants. It provides structured skills and agents that guide AI through project planning, implementation, and verification.

    ## The Problem

    AI coding assistants are powerful but can be chaotic:
    - Jump between tasks without finishing
    - Skip planning and verification steps
    - Make changes without documentation
    - Lack systematic approach to large projects

    ## The Solution

    GSD provides a **structured workflow** that AI assistants follow:

    1. **Research** the domain and libraries
    2. **Plan** phases and tasks systematically
    3. **Execute** plans with atomic commits
    4. **Verify** goals were achieved
    5. **Document** decisions and outcomes

    ## How It Works

    GSD installs **skills** (commands you invoke) and **agents** (specialized sub-agents) to your AI assistant:

    - Skills: `/gsd-plan-phase`, `/gsd-execute-phase`, `/gsd-verify-phase`
    - Agents: gsd-planner, gsd-executor, gsd-verifier

    When you run a skill, the AI assistant:
    1. Loads the skill definition
    2. Follows the structured workflow
    3. Spawns specialized agents for complex tasks
    4. Creates artifacts in `.planning/` directory
    5. Commits progress to git

    ## Key Concepts

    ### Phases
    Logical groupings of work (e.g., "Phase 1: Setup", "Phase 2: Core Features")

    ### Plans
    Executable task lists within a phase (e.g., "01-01-PLAN.md", "01-02-PLAN.md")

    ### Summaries
    Post-execution documentation of what was built (e.g., "01-01-SUMMARY.md")

    ### Verification
    Goal-backward analysis ensuring phase objectives were achieved

    ### .planning/ Directory
    Central repository for all project artifacts:
    \`\`\`
    .planning/
    ├── ROADMAP.md        # Project phases and goals
    ├── REQUIREMENTS.md   # Requirements traceability
    ├── STATE.md          # Current project state
    └── phases/
        └── 01-setup/
            ├── 01-01-PLAN.md
            ├── 01-01-SUMMARY.md
            └── 01-VERIFICATION.md
    \`\`\`

    ## Benefits

    **For Solo Developers:**
    - Systematic approach to large projects
    - Documentation generated automatically
    - Clear progress tracking
    - AI stays focused on goals

    **For Teams:**
    - Consistent development workflow
    - Clear project history in git
    - Easy onboarding (read .planning/)
    - Traceability from requirements to code

    **For AI Assistants:**
    - Structured prompts reduce hallucination
    - Goal-backward verification ensures correctness
    - Specialized agents handle complex tasks
    - Atomic commits enable rollback

    ## Multi-Platform Support

    GSD Multi supports three AI platforms:
    - **Claude Code** - VS Code extension
    - **GitHub Copilot CLI** - Command-line tool
    - **Codex CLI** - OpenAI Codex interface

    All platforms provide the same GSD workflow. Choose based on your AI assistant preference.

    - [How to Install](how-to-install.md) - Get started with installation
    - [What Gets Installed](what-gets-installed.md) - Understand skills and agents
    ```

    **Style:**
    - No emojis
    - High-level overview (not technical implementation)
    - Use "you" pronouns
    - Focus on concepts, not commands

    # How GSD Works

    Step-by-step explanation of the GSD workflow from user perspective.

    ## Overview

    GSD follows a **four-stage workflow** for every project phase:

    1. **Research** → Understand domain and libraries
    2. **Plan** → Break phase into executable tasks
    3. **Execute** → Implement plans with atomic commits
    4. **Verify** → Confirm phase goals achieved

    ## Stage 1: Research

    **Command:** `/gsd-research-phase <phase>`

    **What Happens:**
    1. Researcher agent spawned
    2. Investigates domain, libraries, patterns
    3. Identifies best practices and pitfalls
    4. Creates `RESEARCH.md` in phase directory

    **When to Use:**
    - Novel domains (first time using a library)
    - High-risk decisions (architecture choices)
    - Unclear technical approach

    **When to Skip:**
    - Established patterns in codebase
    - Simple CRUD operations
    - Pure refactoring

    ## Stage 2: Planning

    **Command:** `/gsd-plan-phase <phase>`

    **What Happens:**
    1. Planner agent spawned
    2. Reads ROADMAP.md, RESEARCH.md, STATE.md
    3. Breaks phase into executable tasks
    4. Groups tasks into PLAN.md files
    5. Identifies dependencies and parallelization

    **Output:** Multiple PLAN.md files (e.g., `01-01-PLAN.md`, `01-02-PLAN.md`)

    **Plan Structure:**
    \`\`\`yaml
    ---
    phase: 01-setup
    plan: 01
    wave: 1
    depends_on: []
    files_modified: [...]
    autonomous: true
    ---

    # Objective
    [What this plan achieves]

    # Tasks
    <task name="..." type="auto">
      <files>...</files>
      <action>...</action>
      <verify>...</verify>
      <done>...</done>
    </task>
    \`\`\`

    ## Stage 3: Execution

    **Command:** `/gsd-execute-phase <phase>`

    **What Happens:**
    1. Executor agent spawned for each PLAN.md
    2. Follows task instructions precisely
    3. Makes atomic git commits per task
    4. Creates SUMMARY.md after plan completes

    **Parallel Execution:**
    - Plans in same wave run in parallel
    - Dependencies ensure correct order
    - Each plan is independent

    **Checkpoints:**
    - Human verification checkpoints pause execution
    - User confirms work before continuing
    - Decision checkpoints await user choices

    **Output:** Code changes + SUMMARY.md files

    ## Stage 4: Verification

    **Command:** `/gsd-verify-phase <phase>`

    **What Happens:**
    1. Verifier agent spawned
    2. Reads phase goal from ROADMAP.md
    3. Analyzes codebase (goal-backward)
    4. Confirms observable truths achieved
    5. Creates `VERIFICATION.md` report

    **Goal-Backward Analysis:**
    - Start with phase goal (outcome, not tasks)
    - Derive observable truths (what must be true)
    - Check codebase delivers those truths
    - Report gaps if any

    **Output:** `VERIFICATION.md` with pass/fail status

    ## Continuous Workflow

    Projects proceed phase-by-phase:

    \`\`\`
    Phase 1: Plan → Execute → Verify → Complete
    Phase 2: Plan → Execute → Verify → Complete
    Phase 3: Plan → Execute → Verify → Complete
    ...
    \`\`\`

    Each phase builds on previous phases. STATE.md tracks progress.

    ## Key Files

    | File | Purpose | Created By |
    |------|---------|------------|
    | ROADMAP.md | Project phases and goals | `/gsd-new-project` |
    | REQUIREMENTS.md | Requirements traceability | `/gsd-new-project` |
    | STATE.md | Current project state | Orchestrator |
    | RESEARCH.md | Domain research | `/gsd-research-phase` |
    | PLAN.md | Executable tasks | `/gsd-plan-phase` |
    | SUMMARY.md | What was built | `/gsd-execute-phase` |
    | VERIFICATION.md | Goal verification | `/gsd-verify-phase` |

    ## Specialized Agents

    GSD uses specialized agents for complex tasks:

    - **gsd-researcher**: Domain and library research
    - **gsd-planner**: Phase planning and task breakdown
    - **gsd-executor**: Plan execution with atomic commits
    - **gsd-verifier**: Goal-backward verification
    - **gsd-roadmapper**: Project roadmap creation
    - **gsd-integration-checker**: Cross-phase integration
    - (and 7 more specialized agents)

    Each agent is spawned as needed and works autonomously.

    # How to Customize GSD

    Advanced configuration options for GSD Multi installation.

    ## Installation Scope

    ### Global Installation

    Install GSD skills once for all projects:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --global
    \`\`\`

    **Installs to:**
    - Claude: `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/agents/`
    - Copilot: `~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.copilot/agents/`
    - Codex: `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.codex/agents/`

    **Use when:**
    - You work on many projects
    - You want consistent GSD across projects
    - You use the same AI platform everywhere

    ### Local Installation

    Install GSD per project:

    \`\`\`bash
    cd ~/my-project/
    npx get-shit-done-multi --local
    \`\`\`

    **Installs to:**
    - Claude: `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`
    - Copilot: `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`
    - Codex: `.codex/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`

    **Use when:**
    - You want different GSD versions per project
    - You want project-specific skills
    - You commit skills to git (team collaboration)

    ### Both Global and Local

    You can have both:

    \`\`\`bash
    # Global installation
    npx get-shit-done-multi --global

    # Local installation for specific project
    cd ~/special-project/
    npx get-shit-done-multi --local
    \`\`\`

    **Priority:** Local installation takes precedence over global if both exist.

    ## Platform Selection

    ### Single Platform

    Install to specific platform:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --claude
    npx get-shit-done-multi --copilot
    npx get-shit-done-multi --codex
    \`\`\`

    ### Multiple Platforms

    Install to multiple platforms simultaneously:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --claude --copilot
    npx get-shit-done-multi --claude --copilot --codex
    \`\`\`

    Each platform gets its own installation. Your `.planning/` directory works with all platforms.

    ## Non-Interactive Mode

    Skip prompts for automation:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --claude --global --yes
    \`\`\`

    Useful for:
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - Automated setup scripts
    - Team onboarding scripts

    ## Version Management

    ### Check Installed Versions

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --version
    \`\`\`

    Shows ALL installations (global + local, all platforms):
    \`\`\`
    Installed versions:
    - Claude (global): v2.0.0 at ~/.claude/get-shit-done/
    - Copilot (local): v2.0.0 at .github/get-shit-done/
    \`\`\`

    ### Upgrade All Installations

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi
    \`\`\`

    Installer detects outdated installations and prompts for upgrade.

    ### Upgrade Specific Platform

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --claude --yes
    \`\`\`

    ## Custom Paths (Not Yet Implemented)

    Future feature (v2.1+):

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --custom-path ~/my-skills/
    \`\`\`

    **Workaround for now:**
    1. Install to local directory
    2. Manually move files to custom location
    3. Update platform configuration to point to custom location

    ## Partial Installation (Not Yet Implemented)

    Future feature (v2.1+):

    Select specific skills/agents to install:

    \`\`\`bash
    npx get-shit-done-multi --skills gsd-plan-phase,gsd-execute-phase
    \`\`\`

    **Workaround for now:**
    1. Install all skills
    2. Manually delete unwanted skills
    3. Note: Full installation recommended for complete workflow

    ## Manual Customization

    ### Editing Skills

    You can manually edit installed skills:

    1. Install GSD:
       \`\`\`bash
       npx get-shit-done-multi --local
       \`\`\`

    2. Edit skill file:
       \`\`\`bash
       vim .claude/skills/gsd-plan-phase/SKILL.md
       \`\`\`

    3. Changes persist until reinstall

    **Warning:** Manual edits are overwritten on reinstall. Use version control.

    ### Adding Custom Skills

    Add your own skills alongside GSD:

    1. Create skill file:
       \`\`\`bash
       mkdir .claude/skills/my-custom-skill/
       vim .claude/skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md
       \`\`\`

    2. Follow platform's skill format (see [Platform Specifics](platform-specifics.md))

    3. Your custom skills won't be affected by GSD reinstalls

    ## Uninstall and Reinstall

    Clean slate:

    \`\`\`bash
    # Remove all GSD files
    rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/gsd-* ~/.claude/agents/gsd-* ~/.claude/get-shit-done/

    # Reinstall fresh
    npx get-shit-done-multi
    \`\`\`

    Your `.planning/` directories are NOT affected.

    ## System Overview

    GSD Multi is a **template-based installer** that transforms universal skill/agent templates into platform-specific files. The system follows a clean separation of concerns:

    - **Templates** (`/templates/`) - Universal source of truth
    - **Adapters** (`/bin/lib/adapters/`) - Platform-specific transformations
    - **Orchestrator** (`/bin/lib/orchestrator.js`) - Installation coordination
    - **Validation** (`/bin/lib/validation/`, `/bin/lib/preflight/`) - Security and pre-flight checks

    \`\`\`

    **Template Variables:**
    - `{{PLATFORM_ROOT}}` → `.claude/`, `.github/`, `.codex/`
    - `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}` → `/gsd-`, `$gsd-`
    - `{{VERSION}}` → Current version (e.g., "2.0.0")
    - `{{PLATFORM_NAME}}` → "claude", "copilot", "codex"

    **Frontmatter:**
    - Skills: Corrected format (allowed-tools, argument-hint, no unsupported fields)
    - Agents: Corrected format (tools string, skills auto-generated, no metadata block)

    ### `/bin/lib/adapters/`

    **Purpose:** Platform-specific transformations (one adapter per platform)

    **Files:**
    - `base-adapter.js` - Abstract base class
    - `claude-adapter.js` - Claude Code transformations
    - `copilot-adapter.js` - GitHub Copilot CLI transformations
    - `codex-adapter.js` - Codex CLI transformations

    **Architecture Rule (PLATFORM-02):**
    - Each adapter is ISOLATED - no inheritance between platform adapters
    - Code duplication is ACCEPTABLE over coupling
    - Changes to one platform should NOT affect others

    **Adapter Methods:**
    \`\`\`javascript
    class PlatformAdapter {
      transformFrontmatter(frontmatter, type)  // Transform metadata
      transformTools(tools)                    // Map tool names
      transformPath(path)                      // Rewrite path references
      getFileExtension(type)                   // .md vs .agent.md
      getTargetDir(scope)                      // Installation directory
    }
    \`\`\`

    **Tool Name Mappings:**
    - Claude: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task
    - Copilot/Codex: read, write, edit, execute, search, glob, agent

    ### `/bin/lib/orchestrator.js`

    **Purpose:** Coordinate installation phases

    **Phases:**
    1. Template validation (check templates exist and parse correctly)
    2. Skill installation (transform and write skill files)
    3. Agent installation (transform and write agent files)
    4. Shared directory installation (copy get-shit-done/ folder)
    5. Manifest generation (scan installed files, write manifest)

    **Key Functions:**
    - `installSkills(adapter, scope)` - Install all 29 skills
    - `installAgents(adapter, scope)` - Install all 13 agents
    - `installShared(adapter, scope)` - Copy shared directory with variable replacement
    - `generateAndWriteManifest(targetDir, platform, scope, version)` - Create manifest

    ### `/bin/lib/preflight/`

    **Purpose:** Single-point validation before installation

    **Files:**
    - `pre-flight-validator.js` - Orchestrates all validation

    **Validation Checks:**
    1. Templates exist (`/templates/skills/`, `/templates/agents/`)
    2. Disk space (2MB + 10% buffer)
    3. Write permissions (actual write test)
    4. Path security (8-layer validation)
    5. Symlink detection and resolution
    6. Existing installation detection

    **Validation Flow:**
    \`\`\`javascript
    validateBeforeInstall(targetDir, platform)
      → checks.push(...diskSpaceCheck())
      → checks.push(...permissionsCheck())
      → checks.push(...pathSecurityCheck())
      → checks.push(...symlinkCheck())
      → checks.push(...existingInstallCheck())
      → return { valid: true/false, errors: [], warnings: [] }
    \`\`\`

    ### `/bin/lib/validation/`

    **Purpose:** Transversal validation modules (used by preflight)

    **Files:**
    - `path-validator.js` - 8-layer path security validation
    - `template-validator.js` - Template structure verification

    **Path Validation Layers:**
    1. Null byte check (`\0`)
    2. URL decoding (detect `%2e%2e%2f`)
    3. Traversal detection (`../`, `..\`, absolute paths)
    4. Containment verification (resolved path inside target)
    5. Allowlist enforcement (`.claude`, `.github`, `.codex`, `get-shit-done`)
    6. Length limits (260 Windows, 4096 Unix)
    7. Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, AUX, etc.)
    8. Symlink resolution (single-level only, chains rejected)

    ### `/bin/lib/paths/`

    **Purpose:** Path utilities (used by validation and orchestrator)

    **Files:**
    - `path-resolver.js` - Path resolution and normalization
    - `symlink-resolver.js` - Single-level symlink resolution with chain detection

    ## Installation Flow

    ### Step-by-Step

    1. **Entry Point** (`bin/install.js`):
       - Parse CLI flags
       - Show banner
       - Call pre-flight validation
       - If validation passes → call orchestrator

    2. **Pre-Flight Validation** (`bin/lib/preflight/pre-flight-validator.js`):
       - Collect all validation checks
       - Run checks in parallel
       - Group errors and warnings
       - Return validation result

    3. **Orchestrator** (`bin/lib/orchestrator.js`):
       - Load templates from `/templates/`
       - Parse frontmatter with gray-matter
       - Select platform adapter (Claude/Copilot/Codex)
       - Transform frontmatter → tools → paths
       - Replace template variables
       - Write files to target directory
       - Scan written files
       - Generate manifest with file list

    4. **Manifest Generation** (post-installation):
       - Two-pass write (empty → scan → rewrite)
       - Include manifest itself in files array
       - Store version, platform, scope, timestamp, files

    5. **Success Message**:
       - Show installation summary
       - Display next steps
       - Exit

    ## Key Design Decisions

    ### One-Time Migration (Phase 1)

    - `.github/` → `/templates/` was ONE-TIME migration
    - Migration code committed, then DELETED
    - `/templates/` is permanent source of truth
    - No ongoing conversion pipeline

    ### Platform Isolation (PLATFORM-02)

    - Each adapter is SEPARATE implementation
    - NO inheritance between adapters
    - Code duplication ACCEPTABLE
    - Rationale: Changes to one platform should not affect others

    ### Single-Point Validation (Phase 7.1)

    - Pre-flight validation at entry point
    - No redundant per-file validation
    - Fail-fast with grouped errors
    - Rationale: Better UX, simpler code

    ### Atomic Operations (Phase 5)

    - Pre-flight validation prevents ~80% of failures
    - Post-validation failures leave partial files (acceptable trade-off)
    - Rationale: Pre-flight validation provides atomic behavior for common failure modes

    ### Manifest Tracking (Phase 6)

    - `.gsd-install-manifest.json` in each installation
    - Tracks version, platform, scope, files
    - Used for update detection
    - Generated post-installation (two-pass write)

    ## Testing Strategy

    ### Test Isolation (TEST-01)

    ALL tests execute under `/tmp` directory:

    \`\`\`javascript
    const testDir = `/tmp/gsd-test-\${Date.now()}`;
    // Copy full project to testDir
    // Run tests in testDir
    // Cleanup after test
    \`\`\`

    **Why:** Prevent accidental source file corruption during testing

    ### Integration Tests

    - Copy full project to `/tmp`
    - Execute `install.js` directly
    - Verify output files
    - Check manifest correctness

    ### Unit Tests

    - Path validation
    - Frontmatter transformation
    - Tool name mapping
    - Template variable replacement
