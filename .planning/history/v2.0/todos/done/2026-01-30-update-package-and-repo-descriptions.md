title: Update package.json and repository descriptions
area: docs
files:
  - package.json:4
---

## Problem

The package.json description and the repository description need to be updated to better reflect the current state and purpose of the get-shit-done-multi project. 

User requested:
- Update the description in package.json
- Provide a suitable description for the GitHub repository

Current package.json description is functional but may need refinement to better communicate the value proposition and target audience.

## Solution

1. Review current package.json description (line 4)
2. Analyze project capabilities from README and documentation
3. Craft concise, compelling descriptions that:
   - Clearly state what GSD does
   - Highlight key differentiators (meta-prompting, spec-driven, multi-CLI support)
   - Target developers using AI coding assistants
4. Provide both English description for package.json and repository

Suggested approach:
- Keep it concise (under 160 chars for repo description)
- Lead with value proposition
- Mention key features: planning, execution, debugging, verification workflows
