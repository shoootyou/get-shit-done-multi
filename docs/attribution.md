## Original Creator
**TÂCHES** created the original Get Shit Done system.

**Original project:** https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done

### About the Original

TÂCHES built GSD as a solo developer frustrated with enterprise-theater in other spec-driven development tools. The original vision:

> *"I don't write code — Claude Code does. Other tools make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work."*

The result was a system where complexity lives in the implementation, not the workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What users see: a few commands that just work.

## What This Version Adds

This multi-CLI version extends the original work to support:
- **Claude Code** (original platform)
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** 
- **Codex CLI**

### Technical Extensions
- Skills-based architecture for non-Claude platforms
- Cross-platform agent compatibility
- Unified command system across all three CLIs
- Enhanced documentation and setup guides
- CLI comparison matrix and capability browser

### What Stayed the Same
All core GSD features remain unchanged:
- The workflow philosophy
- Context engineering principles
- XML prompt formatting
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Atomic git commits
- All original commands and features

## Standing on Shoulders of Giants

The brilliance of Get Shit Done comes from TÂCHES' original vision. This version simply makes that brilliance accessible across multiple AI coding platforms while preserving the core philosophy: **no enterprise theater, just build cool stuff that works.**
