# Shared frontmatter for GSD skills
# Skills can inherit these blocks and override specific fields

# Common metadata (skills can override)
metadata:
  category: gsd-command
  system: get-shit-done

# NOTE: Tools are NOT included in shared frontmatter
# Each skill must explicitly declare required tools (principle of least privilege)
# Most GSD commands are reference/documentation only and need no tools
